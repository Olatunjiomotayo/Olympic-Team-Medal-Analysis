## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Olympic Team Medal Analysis is a project that investigates the factors influencing team performance in international sports competitions. Using data visualisation, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques, the project aims to predict the number of medals teams might win based on historical and team-specific attributes.
This repository contains the complete code, analysis, and results of the project, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in sports analytics, predictive modelling, and data-driven decision-making.

## Features
•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handles missing values and irrelevant features for a cleaner dataset.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualises relationships between variables such as athletes, age, and medals.
•	Correlation Analysis: Identifies the strongest predictors for medal outcomes.
•	Machine Learning Modelling: Implements a linear regression model to predict medals won by teams.
•	Error Analysis: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on a dataset containing historical performance data of teams. Key features include:
•	team: Name of the team or country.
•	year: Year of the competition.
•	athletes: Number of athletes representing the team.
•	age: Average age of the team members.
•	prev_medals: Number of medals won in previous competitions.
•	medals: Actual number of medals won in the current competition.
